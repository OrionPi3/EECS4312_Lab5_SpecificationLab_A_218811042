Prompt 1: What are the inputs of this system? What type and format does each take? what values are valid? The inputs of the system are suggest_slots(events, meeting_duration, day)

def suggest_slots( events: List[Dict[str, str]], meeting_duration: int, day: str ) -> List[str]:
def test_single_event_blocks_overlapping_slots(): """ Functional requirement: Slots overlapping an event must not be suggested. """ events = [{"start": "10:00", "end": "11:00"}] slots = suggest_slots(events, meeting_duration=30, day="2026-02-01")

LLM Response 1: Good question — this is exactly the kind of thing the lab wants you to spell out clearly 👍
Let’s break down the inputs of the system, their types, formats, and valid values, based on the description + function signature + tests.

Summary Table
Input	Type	Format	Valid Values
events	List[Dict[str, str]]	{"start": "HH:MM", "end": "HH:MM"}	Valid 24-hour times, start < end, unsorted allowed
meeting_duration	int	Minutes	Positive integer (e.g., 15, 30, 60)
day	str	Any string	Any value (not logically used)

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt 2: what would be the outputs?


LLM Response 2: 

Here’s the output of the system, clearly defined.

Output of the system
Output Type
List[str]

Output Format
A list of strings
Each string represents a valid meeting start time

Time format:
"HH:MM"   (24-hour clock)

Example:
["09:00", "09:15", "10:15", "14:30"]
--------------------------------------------------

Prompt 3: what would be the functional requirements, 6 constraints, 3 invariants, 2 negative requirements then give me the final solutions.py code and the test cases as well please
LLM-Response 3:

1. Functional Requirements

FR1. The system shall accept a list of existing calendar events and a desired meeting duration.
FR2. The system shall compute all possible meeting start times for the given day.
FR3. The system shall exclude any meeting start time that would cause the meeting to overlap with an existing event.
FR4. The system shall only suggest meeting start times that fit entirely within working hours.
FR5. The system shall exclude meeting start times that fall during the lunch break (12:00–13:00).
FR6. The system shall return all valid meeting start times in ascending chronological order.

2. Constraints (6)

C1. Working hours constraint
Meetings may only be scheduled between 09:00 and 17:00.
C2. Lunch break constraint
No meeting may start during the lunch break from 12:00 to 13:00.
C3. Duration constraint
The meeting duration must be a positive integer representing minutes.
C4. Time format constraint
All times must be represented using the "HH:MM" 24-hour format.
C5. Slot granularity constraint
Meeting start times must align to 15-minute increments.
C6. Event relevance constraint
Events that occur completely outside working hours shall not affect availability.

3. Invariants (3)

I1. Time validity invariant
All returned time strings always represent valid 24-hour times.
I2. Ordering invariant
The returned list of meeting start times is always sorted in ascending order.
I3. Non-overlap invariant
No returned meeting start time results in a meeting that overlaps with any event.

4. Negative Requirements (2)

NR1. The system shall not suggest meeting start times that overlap with existing events.
NR2. The system shall not suggest meeting start times during the lunch break (12:00–13:00).
